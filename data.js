    "1.2 Description": "Since 2001, Reef Check Australia (RCA) has supported citizen science reef monitoring projects on reefs around Australia. For the past 20 years, our surveys have helped with the collection of long-term data relating to reef health at a local, national and global scale. RCA�s survey methods collect quantitative data for substrate cover, key invertebrate species, target fish species, as well as anthropogenic and natural impacts in reef habitats. Teams of trained volunteers monitored a total of 30 locations on 18 different reefs, which included survey sites ranging from Mudjimba Island on the Sunshine Coast to Cook Island south of the Gold Coast. Of these 30 locations, 2 reefs were surveyed twice annually (Mud Island � Coral Galore and Rubble Patch), all remaining sites were only surveyed once. Green Island and St Helena Island are typically surveyed twice annually, however the flood event this year prevented the summer surveys from taking place. 12,000m2 of reef habitat was surveyed in total during the 2021- 2022 season (where one survey covers 400m2 ), resulting in more than 4800 pieces of substrate data collected, and more than 1,440 hours donated by trained volunteers.",
